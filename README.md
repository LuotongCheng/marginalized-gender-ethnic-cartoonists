## Description of the datasets
The folder contains datasets concerning the marginalized gender and ethnic comics creators, including the Cartoonists of Color and Queer Cartoonists databases in both CSV and JSON format. The datasets were collected by hand by Thomas Padilla and Mari Naomi in 2015 and posted on Figshare. Padilla is a Digital Scholarship Librarian at Michigan State University Libraries. Mari Naomi is an award-winning author and illustrator. The datasets are derived from the Cartoonists of Color, Queer Cartoonists, and Disabled Cartoonists databases created and maintained by Naomi. The datasets contain biographical information for 861 marginalized cartoonists (ethnicity, gender, creative roles, location, comic titles, genre, etc.).

## Project: Exploring the Relationship between the Artistic Expressions and Intersectional Identities of Cartoonists of Color and Queer Cartoonists 
### Topic and context 
The topic of the project is the intersectionality of the marginalized gender and ethnic comics creators. The concept of Intersectionality was coined by Kimberley Crenshaw in Demarginalizing The Intersection of Race and Sex (1989). It emphasizes the ‘multidimensionality’ of the lived experience of marginalized individuals or groups, which means that various identities such as race, gender, sexuality, and class are interconnected (Crenshaw, 1989, p. 139). Intersectionality “does not only describe the intersecting aspects of any particular person’s identity” but also “describes the intersecting forces of privilege and oppression at work in a given society” (D'Ignazio & Klein, 2020, p. 8). It challenges the idea that oppression can be addressed through a single lens. For example, a black trans woman and a white woman may experience different degrees of racial and gender discrimination. 
### Research question and hypotheses
Social justice is a popular topic in the field of comics. Cartoonists might represent the complexities of intersectionality and challenge social stereotypes. The purpose of the project is to analyze whether the intersectional experience of cartoonists from marginalized ethnic and gender minority groups influences their focus on gender and LGBTQ+ themes. The project aims to examine the following hypotheses:
1. Gender minority cartoonists from ethnic minority groups may focus more on LGBTQ+ themes than gender majority cartoonists from the same ethnic groups. 
2. Gender minority cartoonists from mixed ethnic groups (African American, etc.) may focus more on LGBTQ+ themes than cartoonists from same-gender groups but from other minority ethnic groups. 
### Variables 
To address the above research question and test the hypothesis, the following variables are needed: 
* Gender: this is a variable that categorizes cartoonists into gender majority (male, female) and gender minority (non-binary, transgender, queer, etc.). 
* Ethnicity: this is a variable that captures the cartoonists’ ethnic background and distinguishes whether they are from mixed ethnic groups. 
* Genre: this is a categorical variable that contributes to finding if the theme of the cartoonists’ artworks concerns LGBTQ+ or is related to social justice. 
* Country: this is a categorical variable that contributes to understanding the cultural background of the cartoonists. 
### Data source and type
Both quantitative and qualitative data are needed. The quantitative data includes the biographic or demographic information of cartoonists such as gender, ethnicity, country, and genre. The source of data could be the existing databases that focus on cartoonists such as the Cartoonists of Color and Queer Cartoonists databases by Mari Naomi. To further analyze the intersectional experience of particular cartoonists, qualitative data is required, which can be collected from artwork analyses and interviews with the cartoonists. 
### Analysis plan 
Statistical methods and techniques are needed to analyze the relationship between the three variables (gender, ethnicity, and genre). Coding is required to filter or identify specific gender or ethnic groups, as well as particular genres from the whole dataset. The results can be displayed through a cross-tabulation table or visualized through bar charts for comparative analyses that focus on LGBTQ+ themes among different groups (e.g., gender minority vs. gender majority, mixed ethnic groups vs. other minority ethnic groups).
